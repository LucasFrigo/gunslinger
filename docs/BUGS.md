# Bug tracker

Open gameplay / visual defects. Agents add new reports here and move items to **Fixed** when a change lands (same session as the code). Do not invent bugs.

How to file: next unused `BUG-NNN`, repro steps, arena/mode if known, screenshot under `docs/bugs/` when useful.

## Open

### BUG-004 — Joiner spawns facing away from the opponent

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | `open` |
| Severity | `major` |
| Filed | 2026-08-18 |
| Platforms | 1v1 MP (LAN); joiner / second player |
| Areas | `autoload/game_manager.gd` `setup_mp_duel`, `player/player.gd` `reset_for_duel`, `player/flat_rig.gd` `face_yaw` |

**What:** The joining player is placed on `EnemySpawn` but looks the default direction (back to the host) instead of toward them. Host on `PlayerSpawn` is fine.

**Repro:**
1. Host a LAN duel, second player joins.
2. At standoff, the joiner is on the NPC mark with their back to the opponent.

**Notes:** `setup_mp_duel` gives the joiner `get_enemy_spawn()` (markers already yaw 180° toward `PlayerSpawn`). Flat then applies that yaw again via `face_yaw`, so 180° + 180° = world identity — looking away. VR only `reset_locomotion()` (origin yaw 0); HMD facing stays playspace, not the marker.

### BUG-005 — PvP opponent has no visible body (hard to read aim)

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | `open` |
| Severity | `major` |
| Filed | 2026-08-18 |
| Platforms | 1v1 MP; both flat and VR |
| Areas | `player/remote_avatar.tscn`, `player/remote_avatar.gd` |

**What:** In PvP the other player is only a head/hat plus small hand boxes. Torso and legs are hitboxes with no mesh (unlike the AI capsule `Body`). The revolver stays hidden until the drawn pose flag. Silhouette and aim are hard to read.

**Repro:**
1. Host + join a LAN duel.
2. Look at the opponent during standoff / draw.
3. Compare to a free-duel NPC, who has a full body mesh.

**Notes:** `RemoteAvatar` drives head/hands from the pose stream; `TorsoHitbox` / `LegHitbox` have collision only. Gun visibility is `POSE_FLAG_GUN_DRAWN`.

## Fixed

### BUG-003 — Quest 3 cannot host or see LAN lobbies

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | `fixed` |
| Severity | `blocker` |
| Filed | 2026-08-18 |
| Fixed | 2026-08-18 |
| Platforms | Quest 3 APK vs PC LAN |
| Areas | `export_presets.cfg`, `netcode/lan_discovery.gd` |

**What:** After sideloading the Quest APK, HOST (LAN) on the headset shows "Can't create". Hosting on PC never appears in the Quest LAN list.

**Repro:**
1. Export `Quest 3 (Android)`, `dev\install-quest.bat`.
2. PC: HOST (LAN). Quest: LAN host list stays empty.
3. Quest: HOST (LAN) → `Could not host LAN game: Can't create`.

**Fix:** The Android preset shipped with `INTERNET` (and Wi-Fi multicast) permissions off, so ENet/UDP sockets fail on device. Discovery also only answered pings via `255.255.255.255`, which Android often drops. Permissions are enabled; the host now announces on subnet broadcasts and embeds its LAN IP in the pong. **Re-export and reinstall the APK.**

### BUG-002 — NPC teleports at draw (countdown pose ≠ duel pose)

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | `fixed` |
| Severity | `major` |
| Filed | 2026-08-18 |
| Fixed | 2026-08-18 |
| Platforms | SP AI duels; map-dependent |
| Areas | `ai/duelist_ai.gd`, `autoload/game_manager.gd`, spawn markers in `scenarios/` |

**What:** During standoff / wait-for-bell the NPC stands at one spot; when the duel actually starts they snap closer or to a different position.

**Repro:**
1. Free duel or gauntlet on several arenas (especially ones with a long gap between `PlayerSpawn` and `EnemySpawn`: Canyon, Train Rooftop).
2. Watch the NPC through “Holster” / “Wait for the bell…”.
3. On DRAW, note whether they jump.

**Fix:** `_spawn_position` was captured in `_ready` from local `position` (packed-scene origin) before `GameManager` applied `get_enemy_spawn()`. Sheriff/Ghost strafe then wrote `global_position = _spawn_position + right * sin(...)` and snapped toward world origin. Spawn is now recaptured as `global_position` after placement, and again when the bell rings.

### BUG-001 — Double / bent bullet traces

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | `fixed` |
| Severity | `major` |
| Filed | 2026-08-18 |
| Fixed | 2026-08-18 |
| Platforms | Player and NPC shots (seen in flat; VR unconfirmed) |
| Areas | `weapons/bullet_trail.gd`, `weapons/bullet.gd` |

**What:** One shot drew two glowing traces that met at a sharp angle (sideways V). The kink / split changed with look direction.

**Screenshot:** [`docs/bugs/BUG-001-double-trail.png`](bugs/BUG-001-double-trail.png)

**Fix:** Trails were recording the first point in `_ready` before the bullet was moved to the muzzle (kink from scene origin). The camera-facing ribbon also rebuilt a per-vertex `forward.cross(to_eye)` that flipped along the shot. First point is now taken after spawn placement; the ribbon uses one stable side vector for the whole strip.
